# CaheTest
Simple template app (Koin, MVP, Room, Retrofit, Moxy)

Easy Example, how to use dependency injection with koin.  
For async requests i use coroutines.  
  
"Save" - saves name and data to DB (Room)  
"Show" - shows name and data from DB (Room)  
"Find" - finds record by name field in DB (Room)  
"Delete" - deketess name and data by name in DB (Room)  
"Network" - displays data from test.txt in snackbar (Retrofit)
